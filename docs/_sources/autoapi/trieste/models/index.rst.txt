Package Contents

.. py:class:: ModelConfig

   This class is a specification for building a
   :class:`~trieste.models.TrainableProbabilisticModel`. It is not meant to be used by itself,
   it implements methods that facilitate building a Trieste model as a dictionary of model and
   optimizer arguments with :func:`create_model`.

   .. py:attribute:: model
      :annotation: :Any

      The low-level model to pass to the :class:`~trieste.models.TrainableProbabilisticModel`
      interface registered with the `model` via :class:`ModelRegistry`. The model has to be one of
      the supported models, that is, registered via :class:`ModelRegistry`. We use type `Any` here as
      this can be either a model that is supported by default (for example, GPflow- or GPflux-based
      models) or a user-defined model that has been registered.


   .. py:attribute:: model_args
      :annotation: :dict[str, Any]

      The keyword arguments to pass to the model interface
      :class:`~trieste.models.TrainableProbabilisticModel` registered with the `model` via
      :class:`ModelRegistry`.


   .. py:attribute:: optimizer
      :annotation: :Any

      The low-level optimizer to pass to the :class:`~trieste.models.Optimizer` interface
      registered with the `model` via :class:`ModelRegistry`, with which to train the model (by
      minimizing its loss function).


   .. py:attribute:: optimizer_args
      :annotation: :dict[str, Any]

      The keyword arguments to pass to the optimizer interface :class:`~trieste.models.Optimizer`
      registered with the `model` via :class:`ModelRegistry`.


   .. py:method:: build_model(self) -> trieste.models.interfaces.TrainableProbabilisticModel

      Builds a Trieste model from the model and optimizer configuration.



.. py:class:: ModelRegistry

   This is a registry of all supported models with their corresponding interfaces and optimizers.
   A single entry per model is maintained, if same model is registered again it will overwrite the
   previous entry. Registry is primarily used by :class:`ModelConfig` and :func:`create_model` to
   facilitate building models by specifying a simple dictionary of model and optimizer arguments.

   Note that you do not need to register your custom model if you will provide an instance of
   :class:`~trieste.models.TrainableProbabilisticModel` directly to the
   :class:`~trieste.BayesianOptimizer`. Registering is required if you intend to build your custom
   model as a dictionary of arguments for the interface and the optimizer, or as a
   :class:`ModelConfig`.

   .. py:method:: get_interface(cls, model_type: Type[Any]) -> Type[trieste.models.interfaces.TrainableProbabilisticModel]
      :classmethod:

      Get a Trieste model interface for a given model type.

      :param model_type: The model type.
      :return: The interface which builds a model.


   .. py:method:: get_optimizer(cls, model_type: Type[Any]) -> Type[trieste.models.optimizer.Optimizer]
      :classmethod:

      Get a Trieste model optimizer for a given model type.

      :param model_type: The model type.
      :return: The optimizer to be used with the model type.


   .. py:method:: register_model(cls, model_type: Type[Any], interface_type: Type[trieste.models.interfaces.TrainableProbabilisticModel], optimizer_type: Type[trieste.models.optimizer.Optimizer]) -> None
      :classmethod:

      Register a new model type. Note that this will overwrite a registry
      entry if the model has already been registered.

      :param model_type: The model type.
      :param interface_type: The interface to be used with the model type.
      :param optimizer_type: The optimizer to be used with the model type.


   .. py:method:: get_registered_models(cls) -> Iterable[Any]
      :classmethod:

      Provides a generator with all supported model types.



.. py:data:: ModelSpec
   

   Type alias for any type that can be used to fully specify a model. 


.. py:function:: create_model(config: ModelSpec) -> trieste.models.interfaces.TrainableProbabilisticModel

   Build a model in a flexible way by providing a dictionary of model and optimizer arguments, a
   :class:`ModelConfig`, or a :class:`~trieste.models.TrainableProbabilisticModel`. This function
   is primarily used by :class:`~trieste.BayesianOptimizer` to build a model.

   :param config: A configuration for building a Trieste model.
   :return: A Trieste model built according to ``config``.


.. py:class:: ModelStack(model_with_event_size: tuple[TrainableProbabilisticModel, int], *models_with_event_sizes: tuple[TrainableProbabilisticModel, int])

   Bases: :py:obj:`TrainableProbabilisticModel`

   A :class:`ModelStack` is a wrapper around a number of :class:`TrainableProbabilisticModel`\ s.
   It combines the outputs of each model for predictions and sampling, and delegates training data
   to each model for updates and optimization.

   **Note:** Only supports vector outputs (i.e. with event shape [E]). Outputs for any two models
   are assumed independent. Each model may itself be single- or multi-output, and any one
   multi-output model may have dependence between its outputs. When we speak of *event size* in
   this class, we mean the output dimension for a given :class:`TrainableProbabilisticModel`,
   whether that is the :class:`ModelStack` itself, or one of the subsidiary
   :class:`TrainableProbabilisticModel`\ s within the :class:`ModelStack`. Of course, the event
   size for a :class:`ModelStack` will be the sum of the event sizes of each subsidiary model.

   The order of individual models specified at :meth:`__init__` determines the order of the
   :class:`ModelStack` output dimensions.

   :param model_with_event_size: The first model, and the size of its output events.
       **Note:** This is a separate parameter to ``models_with_event_sizes`` simply so that the
       method signature requires at least one model. It is not treated specially.
   :param \*models_with_event_sizes: The other models, and sizes of their output events.

   .. py:method:: predict(self, query_points: trieste.types.TensorType) -> tuple[trieste.types.TensorType, trieste.types.TensorType]

      :param query_points: The points at which to make predictions, of shape [..., D].
      :return: The predictions from all the wrapped models, concatenated along the event axis in
          the same order as they appear in :meth:`__init__`. If the wrapped models have predictive
          distributions with event shapes [:math:`E_i`], the mean and variance will both have
          shape [..., :math:`\sum_i E_i`].


   .. py:method:: predict_joint(self, query_points: trieste.types.TensorType) -> tuple[trieste.types.TensorType, trieste.types.TensorType]

      :param query_points: The points at which to make predictions, of shape [..., B, D].
      :return: The predictions from all the wrapped models, concatenated along the event axis in
          the same order as they appear in :meth:`__init__`. If the wrapped models have predictive
          distributions with event shapes [:math:`E_i`], the mean will have shape
          [..., B, :math:`\sum_i E_i`], and the covariance shape
          [..., :math:`\sum_i E_i`, B, B].


   .. py:method:: sample(self, query_points: trieste.types.TensorType, num_samples: int) -> trieste.types.TensorType

      :param query_points: The points at which to sample, with shape [..., N, D].
      :param num_samples: The number of samples at each point.
      :return: The samples from all the wrapped models, concatenated along the event axis. For
          wrapped models with predictive distributions with event shapes [:math:`E_i`], this has
          shape [..., S, N, :math:`\sum_i E_i`], where S is the number of samples.


   .. py:method:: predict_y(self, query_points: trieste.types.TensorType) -> tuple[trieste.types.TensorType, trieste.types.TensorType]

      :param query_points: The points at which to make predictions, of shape [..., D].
      :return: The predictions from all the wrapped models, concatenated along the event axis in
          the same order as they appear in :meth:`__init__`. If the wrapped models have predictive
          distributions with event shapes [:math:`E_i`], the mean and variance will both have
          shape [..., :math:`\sum_i E_i`].
      :raise NotImplementedError: If any of the models don't implement predict_y.


   .. py:method:: update(self, dataset: trieste.data.Dataset) -> None

      Update all the wrapped models on their corresponding data. The data for each model is
      extracted by splitting the observations in ``dataset`` along the event axis according to the
      event sizes specified at :meth:`__init__`.

      :param dataset: The query points and observations for *all* the wrapped models.


   .. py:method:: optimize(self, dataset: trieste.data.Dataset) -> None

      Optimize all the wrapped models on their corresponding data. The data for each model is
      extracted by splitting the observations in ``dataset`` along the event axis according to the
      event sizes specified at :meth:`__init__`.

      :param dataset: The query points and observations for *all* the wrapped models.

   .. py:method:: predict(self, query_points: trieste.types.TensorType) -> tuple[trieste.types.TensorType, trieste.types.TensorType]
      :abstractmethod:

      Return the mean and variance of the independent marginal distributions at each point in
      ``query_points``.

      This is essentially a convenience method for :meth:`predict_joint`, where non-event
      dimensions of ``query_points`` are all interpreted as broadcasting dimensions instead of
      batch dimensions, and the covariance is squeezed to remove redundant nesting.

      :param query_points: The points at which to make predictions, of shape [..., D].
      :return: The mean and variance of the independent marginal distributions at each point in
          ``query_points``. For a predictive distribution with event shape E, the mean and
          variance will both have shape [...] + E.


   .. py:method:: predict_joint(self, query_points: trieste.types.TensorType) -> tuple[trieste.types.TensorType, trieste.types.TensorType]
      :abstractmethod:

      :param query_points: The points at which to make predictions, of shape [..., B, D].
      :return: The mean and covariance of the joint marginal distribution at each batch of points
          in ``query_points``. For a predictive distribution with event shape E, the mean will
          have shape [..., B] + E, and the covariance shape [...] + E + [B, B].


   .. py:method:: sample(self, query_points: trieste.types.TensorType, num_samples: int) -> trieste.types.TensorType
      :abstractmethod:

      Return ``num_samples`` samples from the independent marginal distributions at
      ``query_points``.

      :param query_points: The points at which to sample, with shape [..., N, D].
      :param num_samples: The number of samples at each point.
      :return: The samples. For a predictive distribution with event shape E, this has shape
          [..., S, N] + E, where S is the number of samples.


   .. py:method:: predict_y(self, query_points: trieste.types.TensorType) -> tuple[trieste.types.TensorType, trieste.types.TensorType]
      :abstractmethod:

      Return the mean and variance of the independent marginal distributions at each point in
      ``query_points`` for the observations, including noise contributions.

      Note that this is not supported by all models.

      :param query_points: The points at which to make predictions, of shape [..., D].
      :return: The mean and variance of the independent marginal distributions at each point in
          ``query_points``. For a predictive distribution with event shape E, the mean and
          variance will both have shape [...] + E.


   .. py:method:: get_observation_noise(self) -> trieste.types.TensorType
      :abstractmethod:

      Return the variance of observation noise.

      Note that this is not supported by all models.

      :return: The observation noise.


   .. py:method:: get_kernel(self) -> gpflow.kernels.Kernel
      :abstractmethod:

      Return the kernel of the model.
      :return: The kernel.


   .. py:method:: log(self) -> None

      Log model-specific information at a given optimization step.



.. py:class:: TrainableProbabilisticModel

   Bases: :py:obj:`ProbabilisticModel`

   A trainable probabilistic model.

   .. py:method:: update(self, dataset: trieste.data.Dataset) -> None
      :abstractmethod:

      Update the model given the specified ``dataset``. Does not train the model.

      :param dataset: The data with which to update the model.


   .. py:method:: optimize(self, dataset: trieste.data.Dataset) -> None
      :abstractmethod:

      Optimize the model objective with respect to (hyper)parameters given the specified
      ``dataset``.

      :param dataset: The data with which to train the model.
